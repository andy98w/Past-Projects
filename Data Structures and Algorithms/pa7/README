PA7 runs an executable called Order with a Dictionary ADT in C++. This program assigns each line of the input file to the order that it was read, stores values into the Dictionary ADT, and prints the sorted values based on alphabetical order into the output file. 
Order.cpp:
    The executable program ./Order <inputfile> <outputfile> executes to the output file lines that read "key : value\n" with key being the word read 
    from the input file, and value being the order it was read.
Dictionary.cpp:
    This cpp program is the main part of our Dictionary ADT. It defines all our functions and helper functions as well as node definition function.
Dictionary.h:
    Header file for our Dictionary ADT. It will contain all the functions and declare our Dictionary ADT struct.
DictionaryTest.cpp:
    A test to try all the functions in Dictionary.cpp. Run with 'Make DictionaryTest' and ./DictionaryTest.
Makefile:
    Makefile for our program, shows command line prompts.
