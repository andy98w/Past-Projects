PA5 runs an executable called shuffle with a linked list ADT in C++. This program runs the 'perfect shuffle' algorithm on a set number of cards. 
Shuffle:
    The executable program ./Shuffle <number of cards> prints a list of 1 to n number of cards and how many perfect shuffles it takes to reset the 
    deck back to the starting point (in order from 0 to n-1). Thus, each length of cards will be n and the highest value card will be n-1. Shuffle
    uses our list ADT to concatenate two seperate lists developed from splitting the original list of cards in two. 
List.cpp:
    This cpp program is the main part of our list ADT. We use this in accordance with List.h to declare our functions for our lists to be used in 
    other programs like shuffle. The full list of functions will be in List.h.
List.h:
    Header file for our list ADT. It will contain all the functions and declare our list ADT struct.
ListTest.cpp:
    A test to try all the functions in List.cpp. Run with 'Make ListTest' and ./ListTest.
Makefile:
    Makefile for our program, shows command line prompts.
