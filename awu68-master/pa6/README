PA6 runs an executable called Arithmetic  with a linked list ADT in C++. This program runs the Airthmetic's such as multiplication and addition
on big integers that are too long to be stored in the types in c++. Instead, we store these in our linked list ADT that we defined in pa5.
Arithmetic.cpp:
    The executable program ./Arithmetic <inputfile> <outputfile> executes to the output file multiplication and addition of the two big integers
    in the input file. This will only take the first two integers of the input file as any more will be ignored. That being said, the first line must
    be a number, the second will be a blank, and the third will be a number.
List.cpp:
    This cpp program is the main part of our list ADT. We use this in accordance with List.h to declare our functions for our lists to be used in 
    other programs like ListTest and Arithmetic, and Biginteger. The full list of functions will be in List.h.
List.h:
    Header file for our list ADT. It will contain all the functions and declare our list ADT struct.
ListTest.cpp:
    A test to try all the functions in List.cpp. Run with 'Make ListTest' and ./ListTest.
BigInteger.cpp:
    The program that holds out BigInteger ADT. It contains the functions to run the arithmetics such as "add" and "sub" and "mult". It also contains
    constructors and overloaded operands so that we can easily call them in our Arithmetic program to compute our large numbers. The list of functions
    are in BigInteger.h.
BigInteger.h:
    Header file for our BigInteger ADT.
BigIntegerTest.cpp:
    A test program to try functions in BigInteger.cpp. Run with 'Make BigIntegerTest' and ./BigIntegerTest.
Makefile:
    Makefile for our program, shows command line prompts.
