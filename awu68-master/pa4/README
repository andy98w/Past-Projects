Programming assignment 4 uses a Matrix ADT that points to an array of lists. Each list has "entries" which are another private node struct in the
Matrix.c file which has a double value and an integer column. Thus, we changed our list ADT to hold void pointer values. We will perform several
arithematic functions on the matrices created by the Sparse file, the main executable of this programming assignment. We do this by iterating through
each 'i' list (Matrix->list[i]) and finding the column integer of each entry, and then computing using the double value of each entry. This program 
also comes with a Matrix test and a list test which can be used by the command 'make MatrixTest' and 'make ListTest' to test the ADTs for each. 
The main Sparse executable will be run using ./Sparse <inputfile> <outputfile>. List.c and List.h hold contents of the List ADT and Matrix.c and 
Matrix.h hold the contents of the Matrix ADT. As always, .h are header files.
