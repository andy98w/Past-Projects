This program was written to run Breadth First searches on graphs constructed with Graph ADTs. These Graph ADTs utilize an array of Linked List
 ADTs to store adjacent vertices. Each of these Linked Lists can be accessed using Graph->array[i]. This also applies to the other arrays used 
 to store colors, distance, and parents. Color is used for the BFS algorithm, and distance calculates distance from a source vertex to the 
 given vertex. This program should be run with an input file and an output file given in that order to the command ./Findpath after running 
 the make file. Furthermore, a GraphTest.c file can be ran using 'Make GraphTest' and executed with ./GraphTest. This will not run the main 
 FindPath file but rather test the Graph ADT using all of its functions. Graph will also include a List.h and List.c file to reference the 
 List ADTs. Graph.h stores all of the functions defined in Graph.c, the main part of the Graph ADT with all of its functions.
