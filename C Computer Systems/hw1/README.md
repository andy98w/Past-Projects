PIG.c is meant to be run using the makefile provided, as well as another file 'names.h'. The names file contains all the possible 10 names for the players. By using the command 'make', would could compile the 'pig.c' program, and use './pig' to run the program. 
'Pig.c' is supposed to run simulations of the game 'Pass the Pigs' in which 2 user inputs are taken: number of players and random seed. Random seed is necessary to ensure the 'random()' function generates a different outcome for each seed. Players will take turns spinning a random number generator until a player reaches 100 points (each number with the exception of a 'side' roll will generate a certain number of points).
