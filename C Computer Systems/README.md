C Programming by Andy Wu

hw1: 'Pig' game where each player may roll a dice to add or subtract to their score. As many players may participate, but game ends when a player reaches 100 points.

hw2: Write functions to perform tasks on arrays of integers.

hw3: Stack-based calculator that takes inputs from a text file and does arithmetic functions.

hw4: Open a text file with a number of vertices and connections between each of the vertices, then search vertices for the shortest or the longest path either using breadth first search or depth first search. Breadth first search uses a queue to keep track of vertices while Depth First search uses a stack. 

hw5: 'Wordle' which takes a user input of 5 letters. Users will have to guess the correct 5 letter word. It will return green if the user’s word has a matching letter in the correct slot of the answer word in the position of the correct letter, gray if the user’s word does not have that letter in the answer word, and yellow if the user’s word has the same letter as the answer word but not in the correct slot.

hw6: Using the Wordle vocabulary list we did in homework 5 and adding a checker for letter score and word scores. It will also remove words from the vocabulary list that do not have the guessed letter and words that do not have letters in the exact position the guess’s letter has.

hw7: Programming from scratch a program that takes in a customers.tsv file and reading it. This code will then make a hash table for the tab separated values in the customers file, with customer nodes containing an email, a name, a shoesize, and a favorite food. We will store these values in a hashtable of a linked list of customer structs.
